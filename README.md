Welcome to the Of-Course.guide application. Of-Course is an online portal supporting a global community of instructors and learners. Instructors can create and manage courses and course sessions.  Learners can peruse available courses, look at detailed information about a course. Learners can also manage their enrollment(s) in available courses.

> 2. Allowing users to browse the catalog of courses
> 3. Allowing users to view a course description on a separate page, where they can enroll or (if enrolled) un-enroll from that course
